Nion Swift User's Guide (0.13.8)
=================================
Nion Swift is open source scientific image processing software integrating hardware control, data acquisition,
visualization, processing, and analysis using Python. Nion Swift is easily extended using Python. It runs on
Windows, Linux, and macOS.

Nion Swift is being developed for the operation of Nion electron microscopes and also as an offline tool to visualize,
process, and analyze scientific data from electron microscopes, other instrumentation, and other scientific fields.

Nion Swift is open source. You can find the source code on
`GitHub Nion Swift <https://github.com/nion-software/nionswift/>`_.

Nion Swift should currently be considered **beta** level software.

Installation
------------
To install Nion Swift, you will need to install a Python environment with some specific Python packages. When you
initially launch the application, it will ask you for the directory of that Python environment.

For specific installation details and download links, see the installation link below. Instructions to install
additional packages to extend Nion Swift are also covered in that link.
