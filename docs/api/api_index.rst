What is the Nion Swift API?
===========================
The Nion Swift API allows developers the ability to control and extend Nion Swift and its extensions and plug-ins.

The API is a versioned API. This allows developers to write to a specific version of the API and know that their
scripts and extensions will work across different versions of Nion Swift that support their required API version.
