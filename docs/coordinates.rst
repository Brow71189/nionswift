Coordinate Systems
==================
To be consistent with scripting and Python NumPy coordinates, all coordinate systems increase towards the right and
down.

The pixel coordinate system displays pixels and can be displayed with the origin at the top-left or the origin at the
center.

The relative coordinate system displays fractional coordinates and can be displayed with the origin at the top-left and
a range of 0.0 to 1.0 or with the origin at the center a range of -1.0 to 1.0.

The calibrated coordinate system displays calibrated coordinates. The origin is determined by the calibration offset.
