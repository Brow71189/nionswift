Python Scripting Overview
=========================

Learning Python
---------------
We assume that you are familiar with Python programming, syntax, and usage. If you're new to Python, consider the book
`Think Python <http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/>`_, available for free on the web or for a small charge on
Amazon. The `Hitchhikers Guide to Python <http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/>`_ also provides some practical
information and tutorials on getting started.

Getting Help
------------
You can contact us using the email address `swift@nion.com <mailto:swift@nion.com>`_. Sending email to that address will
go straight to the developers and we will respond via email. We can also provide contact information for instant message
sessions.

Scripting, Packages, and Plug-Ins
---------------------------------
The *Nion Swift API* gives access to the user interface and data. It is intended to be stable, meaning that applications
written using the API will remain valid and function the same in the future, independent of changes to Nion Swift
itself.

There are many ways to access the API and extend Nion Swift using Python:

    * :ref:`python-console` - Run Python from a command line console
    * :ref:`python-interactive` - Run files that interact with the user
    * Computed Data Items - Short Python scripts to update data when sources change
    * :ref:`python-external` - External access via PyCharm, iPython/Jupyter, or command line
    * :ref:`python-extensions` - Customized extensions using Python packages and modules
    * Open Source Development - Main source code for Nion Swift
