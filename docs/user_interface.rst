User Interface
==============

Workspaces
----------
The workspace is the area where you can view your data.

The workspace can be subdivided into display panels and the size of the display panels can be adjusted by dragging on their edges.

You can drag external files into display panels to import them.

You can drag items from the data panel to the display panels to show them.

You can select one or more display panels for processing by clicking to select one or shift-clicking to select multiple.

If you do processing or acquisition which produces new data, its associated display item will be displayed in an empty display panel if available.

See :ref:`display-panels`.

Data Panel
----------
The data panel lists the display items in your project.

You can drag items from the data panel to display panels in the workspace.

You can delete display items (and associated data items if they become orphaned) by selecting them in the data panel and pressing the delete key.
